##Intorduction

In this project, we use the data collected from accelerometers attached to the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants during exercise. The collected data is used for training of a machine learning model, and then used to predict if they have performed the exercise coorectly or incorrectly.

##Data Processing

The dataset that we use can be downloaded from these URLs for 

1. The training dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
2. The testing dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

###Load the Data

Assuming we have downloaded the data set from the URLs in the previous section, we load the data:

```{r readData, cache=TRUE}
# having explored the data previously, i have observed that there are na.strings
# in the data, so we'll mark them as such with this na.strings vector
naStrings <- c("NA", "#DIV/0!", "")

trainingSet <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv", na.strings=naStrings)
testingSet <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv", na.strings=naStrings)

```

##Appendix


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
